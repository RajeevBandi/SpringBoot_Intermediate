# Authentication and Authorization in Spring Boot

## Introduction
Authentication and authorization are key aspects of security in Spring Boot applications. Authentication verifies a user's identity, while authorization determines their access rights.

## Types of Authentication
### 1. **Basic Authentication**
- Uses `username` and `password` in HTTP headers.
- Simple but less secure for production.
- Works via `Spring Security` by configuring security settings.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- Credentials are exposed if HTTPS is not used.
- No built-in session management, leading to frequent re-authentication.
- Vulnerable to brute-force and replay attacks.

### 2. **Token-Based Authentication (JWT)**
- Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users.
- Stateless and scalable.
- Works by issuing a signed token upon successful login, which is sent in requests.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- If a token is stolen, it can be used until it expires.
- Requires additional security measures like token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
- Cannot be revoked easily unless a token blacklist is maintained.

### 3. **OAuth2 Authentication**
- Standard for third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- Provides secure access delegation.
- Uses access tokens issued by an authorization server.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- Complex to configure and implement.
- Managing access tokens and refresh tokens requires additional effort.
- May require integration with an external identity provider.

### 4. **LDAP Authentication**
- Uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol for authentication.
- Common in enterprise environments.
- Integrates with Spring Security's LDAP module.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- Requires setting up and maintaining an LDAP server.
- Performance can be affected if the LDAP directory is large.
- Can be complex to integrate with modern authentication systems.

### 5. **Database Authentication**
- Validates credentials against a database.
- Uses `UserDetailsService` for fetching user details.
- Works with password encoding for security.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- Requires strong password hashing and salting mechanisms.
- Performance impact if the database is heavily queried.
- Password reset and account management features need to be manually implemented.

## Types of Authorization
### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Users have roles with specific permissions.
- Implemented using `@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`, and `@RolesAllowed` annotations.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- Difficult to manage when users have multiple roles.
- Requires frequent updates as permissions evolve.
- Role explosion can occur if too many roles are defined.

### 2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
- Grants access based on attributes (user, environment, resources).
- More flexible but complex to implement.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- Requires a detailed policy definition.
- More computationally intensive than RBAC.
- Hard to debug and audit access rules.

### 3. **OAuth2 Authorization**
- Uses access tokens to control resource access.
- Managed through scopes and policies.

#### **Drawbacks:**
- Requires an external authorization server setup.
- Managing scopes and policies can become complex.
- Security risks if tokens are misused or exposed.

## How It Works in Spring Boot
1. A user sends credentials (e.g., username & password).
2. Spring Security filters handle authentication.
3. If valid, a session or token is created.
4. Requests are checked for valid authentication.
5. Authorization rules determine allowed actions.

## Conclusion
Spring Boot provides various authentication and authorization mechanisms, each with its own advantages and challenges. Choosing the right method depends on the application requirements and security needs. Proper security measures such as encryption, secure storage, and token expiration handling are necessary to mitigate risks.
